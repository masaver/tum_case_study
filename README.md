This folder contains the main scripts and results from my programming homework task, for my application to the "Bioinformatician | Data Scientist" role at TUM

The bulk of the code used in this task is in the jupyter notebook `./code/01_data_structure_exploration.ipynb`. The companions R script `./code/02_ComplexHeatmap_clust.R`, is called within the jupyter notebook to create a Heatmap from the normalized data, using the R package ComplexHeatmap.

The main results & conclusions of this task are summarized in the `Task_Summary.pptx` power point.
